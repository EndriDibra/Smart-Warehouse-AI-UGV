# Smart-Warehouse-AI-UGV
This is a project created for the Digital Twin course from NKUA-DIND, and concerns an AI-Powered Unmanned Ground Vehicle, that will be used in a smart Warehouse to perform tasks like QR code scanning for Warehouse Navigation & Route Optimization and Real-Time Inventory Updates. Then people counting for crowded areas prevention, face recognition about Security & Access Control and ultimately Environmental Monitoring for Product Safety and Gas Leak & Air Quality Monitoring. The UGV robot's features will be described in a pdf.
